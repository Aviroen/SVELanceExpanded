    "Date.Saloon.Late.04": "Frankly, I may even go as far as to call it a pattern of sorts.#$b#I'm sure you've heard it from those that engage further with me. #$b#It is more or less always some variation of 'I thought he was one thing until I spoke with him longer and I realized he was something else'.",
    "Date.Saloon.Late.05": "I have spent a thousand years roaming this plane, @.#$b#I am aware of the impression I give to those unfamiliar with me.#$b#After all, I was the one that meticulously crafted that image to begin with.",

    "Date.Saloon.Late.19.1": "But to conclude this long story,#$b#It was the day that your presence lulled me to sleep that I knew I could not let you go without at least trying.#$b#In the time it took for me to build up the courage, my love for you only grew deeper until I could no longer think of anything but your smile.#$b#I was sure that all I'd accomplish would be shattering my heart once more...#$b#...Yet you returned my feelings.#$b#No words can describe my uncontrollable elation in that moment.#$b#...And the pure joy that followed every day after.",

    "Date.Saloon.Late.30": "Yes, under that logic, fate is indeed a far more malleable force compared to others.#$b#Yet evidence shows that fate has its own will.",
    "Date.Saloon.Late.31": "Countless times in history have we seen fate rebound back on those that demand too much from it.#$b#It is easy to dismiss such events as coincidence or merely the world's tendency to prefer some sort of equilibrium, but the existence of spontaneous fate lines such as yours say otherwise.",
    "Date.Saloon.Late.32": "That is not to say your deep fate lines aren't natural, my love.#$b#It's simply the fact that so much seems to rest in your hands from no choice of your own that is counter to how we traditionally saw fate.#$b#One thing is still certain, however.#$b#While fate may provide the opportunity, it is still up to the individual to make the most of it.",
    "Date.Saloon.Late.33": "To be selected as fate's champion is no easy task.#$b#You've seen as much from your interactions with this valley.#$b#I merely hope that by joining hands with you, I may take some of those burdens from your shoulders, my heart.#$b#I would not wish for you to be crushed by fate's nebulous intentions, whatever they may be.",
    "Date.Saloon.Late.33.1": "If there is one thing you may take from this conversation, it is this:#$b#I will always support you, @.#$b#Whether it be fate's whims or a goal you have decided on, I will always be here to help you, my love.",
    "Date.Saloon.Late.34": "Truthfully, @, I doubt there will ever be a day where I am completely comfortable with mundane folk of this era.#$b#My frame of reference for social interaction has been irreparably distorted by the passage of time.#$b#Even after spending so much time with you, I am not much closer to 'fitting in' with the villagers.#$b#That isn't to say there hasn't been a marked improvement, however.#$b#I am at least able to somewhat comfortably communicate my requests with individuals like Gus and respond appropriately to casual greetings.#$b#If anything, the fact that I now have greetings to respond to speaks volumes of how our relationship has changed the town's perspective on my existence.",
    "Date.Saloon.Late.35": "Do not expect much more of my social skills my love!#$b#I still fight the urge to teleport away when anyone other than you wishes to engage in small talk while I am unprepared.#$b#I doubt many would react as you did when I begin rambling about the Shrine of Illusions!#$b#...Though, I suppose I would now simply ramble about you instead.",

    "Date.Saloon.Late.45": "Delicious as usual.#$b#Still, you have not answered my question, @.#$b#What about our initial encounters convinced you to dedicate time to getting to know an eccentric recluse living on the edge of the forest?#$b#I'm certain it wasn't the potion I pushed you to drink in the least!",
    "Date.Saloon.Late.46": "...I seemed like a good person?#$b#Are you certain, @?#$b#What part of me seemed like a good person?",
    "Date.Saloon.Late.47": "Indeed, I did reach out to help you in regards to the Junimos, but you should now be more than aware of how that was an action taken under orders.",
    "Date.Saloon.Late.48": "No, of course the Ministry never issued specifics I had to follow.#$b#I just...#$b#All I can seem to recall of our first encounters was me lecturing you about not letting your own importance fuel your ego.#$b#I doubt that made for the best of impressions.",
    "Date.Saloon.Late.49": "...It made me seem incredibly wise and mysterious?#$b#All I am hearing is that fate decided to grant me a miracle on her ever fickle whims!",
    "Date.Saloon.Late.49.1": "I did not mean to frustrate you, my love, but I truly do not see what it is that is so appealing about me.#$b#Compared to your brilliance, I am a mere black speck cast upon a dark void.#$b#Let alone falling in love, the fact that you have noticed me at all is in itself a miracle.#$b#I know that you do not enjoy hearing me self deprecate, but it is the truth.#$b#I have all the intention to embrace this twist of destiny as long as it remains in my reach.",
    "Date.Saloon.Late.50": "Now, what do you say to extending this date a while longer?#$b#The night is still young after all!",

You were the one who largely put together these dishes after all.",
    "Date.Picnic.Late.04": "Yum! Lance even kept it warm with magic!",
    "Date.Picnic.Late.05": "I know I proposed this outing as a training excursion, but it would be a shame not to bask in swirling energies of the valley.#$b#This place has only become more beautiful over the years.#$b#I'm sure your presence had a hand in that gradual change, my love.",

    "Date.Picnic.Late.10": "Let's visit the Sprite Spring!",
    "Date.Picnic.Late.11": "What about a stroll through the secret woods?",


    "Date.Picnic.Later_forest.01": "Excellent suggestion, my heart!#$b#Shall we stroll through the western forest for a change?#$b#We often go for the sake of maintaining the barrier, but it too shares much of this valley's splendour.",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_forest.02": "Then let us depart, beloved.#$b#Take my hand. I will lead you through the dense sea of trees.",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_forest.03": "Yes, this is the portion of the river I was speaking of.",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_forest.04": "Unlike the river that feeds from the mountain near the mine, this river originates to the range directly north of our farm.#$b#Said peaks act as a natural barrier for clouds and other similar weather phenomena, resulting in the desert to the north.",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_forest.05": "Why did I want to visit this point in the river with you?#$b#Frankly I simply found it a charming part of the forest rarely seen by the folk living within this valley.#$b#Almost our own little river bank I may be so daring to proclaim.#$b#I would like to see what would dare interrupt us all the way out here.",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_forest.06": "I was joking before, but now...",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_forest.07": "So... what do you say, my heart?#$b#Would you like to do some outdoor 'training'?",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_forest.08": "I will apply a glimmer as usual, of course.#$b#There is a zero chance of us being discovered. I guarantee it.#$b#After all, I am very possessive when it comes to the love of my life.",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_forest.09": "Why here?#$b#Frankly, I long to see you cut loose as you have done to me countless times before, my love.#$b#As you have constantly pushed my boundaries, it is fair I push yours a little as well, is it not?#$b#But if you are truly opposed, we can always walk back to the tower instead.",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_forest.10": "Mmmm...#$b#Thank you for believing in me, my love.#$b#I promise to make it worth your trust.",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_forest.11": "...Lance and I explored each other amongst the trees, grass, and open sky...",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_forest.12": "...I don't think I could ever look at the forest the same way again...",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_forest.13": "Are your legs unsteady, my love?#$b#Perhaps we overdid it a little.",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_forest.14": "Come here. I'll carry you home in my arms.#$b#You are my lovely woodland fairy after all.^You are my lovely woodland princess after all.#$b#I love you, @.",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_forest.15": "How was it, @? Your first time 'training' out in the open?#$e#Hmm? Me?#$b#I would not go as far as to call it a 'preference', my love, but a person picks up a lot of odd ideas while travelling.#$b#I thought it would be fun to do something a little different than usual.#$b#Clearly, my intuition was correct considering how immersed you were soon after beginning.#$e#Call me a lewd old man all you like.#$b#You were the one who indulged me.#$b#...And you were also the one who was begging for more near the end, my heart.^...And you were also the one who was begging for more near the end, my sweet princess.",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_forest.16": "What role does mana play in all that?#$b#That is a rather complex question, my love.#$b#The cycles of our world and life have foundations in both science and magic.#$b#It is only recently that humanity has begun to understand the former and the latter is still a mystery to even those of us who practice it.#$b#In a sense, magic can too, be boiled down to formulas and calculations, but its components are far more abstract.#$b#In a sense, much of modern magic is an attempt to standardize that abstraction as science has been among the mundane.#$b#I cannot deny its effectiveness at passing along information and producing consistent effects, but such a structured framework also places limitations where there were none before.#$b#Thus, it isn't uncommon to find more experienced practitioners drifting back to relearn older models of magic even if they are oftentimes less practical in use.#$b#I have also heard inklings of attempts to combine science and magic in their entirety.#$b#I would be happy to share such discoveries with you as they arise.",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_forest.17": "What am I teaching you?#$b#You are aware of the freeform nature of your magical training, my love.#$b#I have been attempting to tailor what I teach you based on your personal needs, your talents, what the Ministry would allow, what I personally know, and the fundamentals.#$b#Suffice it to say your roots lie somewhere between the old and new.#$b#I personally believe it is a good place for you to reside until you yourself have something you wish to pursue, my love.#$b#And when you finally do, I will be with you every step of the journey.",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_forest.18": "Lance and I spent the rest of the afternoon strolling along the river...",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_forest.19": "We talked a lot about what my magic niche could be and other interesting magic-related novelties.",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_forest.20": "I think I understand magic a little more now!",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_forest.21": "Ah, how great it is to finally have one I can speak with regarding all aspects of my work and interests!#$b#I did not know how much I longed for something as simple as this until I had finally obtained it.#$b#Thank you, my love.#$b#You do not know even a fraction of how much your existence means to me.",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_forest.22": "Have I been to the Calico desert?#$b#Why of course, I have, my love.#$b#Somewhat recently, in fact.#$b#Recently for a wizard at least.#$b#I believe the last time I inspected the seals was around a century ago.",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_forest.23": "Indeed, I am in fact the one who placed the seal on skull cavern.#$b#I am not surprised that you managed to decipher the messages carved within the walls, however.#$b#You have proven yourself to be extraordinary every moment we have known one another.",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_forest.24": "...What happened?#$b#That is... quite the complicated story, I'm afraid.#$b#Sadly, it is not what I would call a happy one either.",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_forest.25": "What was called the Calico deserts once stretched for more north than it does today, much of the lands since engulfed by the cloud of void energies that haunt Galdora.#$b#We have been making a great effort to contain the spread of the void domain, but accidents are bound to occur from time to time.#$b#We are only human after all.",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_forest.26": "The original incident occurred during my adventuring days with my ex-wife.#$b#It was one of the rare occasions where we'd agreed on a course of action...#$b#...Even if somewhat reluctantly.",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_forest.27": "I do not know what triggered the initial expansion of the void domain.#$b#From the sparse details we were given, it was likely the consequence of the intercrossing of iridium and void energies in an unexpected way.#$b#It had managed to cause some sort of mass curse on an entire city, turning what was once a bustling transport hub into a den of undead and other similar monsters.#$b#The concentration of void energies only served to draw in more such creatures from deep underground.#$b#We were recruited to help deal with the situation as two of the most offensively focused practitioners active at the time.#$b#...But not even we could deal with monsters numbering in the hundreds of thousands...#$b#Not when they still had some fleeting semblances of humanity left...",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_forest.28": "You are aware of what occurs to the fallen of Galdora.#$b#It was no different here.#$b#With each loss, the enemy forces grew.#$b#We did not want to risk another exclusionary zone, not that close to several large settlements and a spiritually significant place like the valley, at least.#$b#Thus, all of us magicians who'd been gathered by the Ministry made a drastic decision:#$b#Sink the entire city and everything tainted by the void deep into the sands themselves.",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_forest.29": "Void energies originate from deep within the earth itself.#$b#Despite its damaging nature to us, it too is a force of nature and key to maintaining balance.#$b#Thus, the best solution was to return it where it should lie before whatever incident caused it to surface.#$b#The iridium mine that had played a large part in the original disaster would act as the ideal focal anchoring point for the spell.#$b#It would also serve as a way to disperse the monster hoard somewhat, making it far more practical to slowly eliminate them in small groups, floor by floor if anyone were determined enough to do so.#$b#Hopefully, by the time they reached the buried city far below, the numbers would have significantly thinned out by then.",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_forest.30": "How did I get referenced on the plaques?#$b#My specialization as a planes Wizard made me ideal for handling the vast amounts of mana required for such a complex spell.#$b#I was already extremely well versed in large area-of-effect magic from my experience in the war, so it made most sense for me to complete the final casting.#$b#If I had to offer a hypothesis, that role I played may have made me out to be the one to decide their fate in the undead's eyes.#$b#I do not mind being accredited such a sin, my love.#$b#After all, I was one who agreed on the premise of the greater good even if I was uncomfortable with prospect.#$b#In a sense, it is rather poetic that you became the hero they sought to finally set their souls free.#$b#Many have taken the thankless task over the years in both a sense of justice and for the rich iridium deposits still existing within that mine...#$b#But unlike them, your prowess in fighting monsters is near unmatched.#$b#I'm sure you made short work of many of their twisted forms.",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_forest.31": "As for how I became responsible for the seals despite the Calico desert officially falling under Castle Village...#$b#It is simply more convenient for the person who cast the seal to inspect it.#$b#Not to mention, I would not need to fight against the void energies to actually make a trip to skull cavern compared to anyone from Castle Village.",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_forest.32": "Well, my love?#$b#How do you feel after learning of another of my heaviest sins?",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_forest.33": "...You do not consider literally sinking an entire city and its people below the sands a sin?",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_forest.34": "Yes, you are correct. That is a rather disingenuous way of wording the events. #$b#...The majority of my guilt lies within how we ultimately chose to handle what occurred with what was convenient for us above all else.#$b#What I did to those people was subject them to an endless existence of torment, @.#$b#You saw those plaques.#$b#They have not lost themselves entirely.#$b#Yet, we treated them like mindless monsters, extending their suffering by pushing the true final solution to later generations.#$b#What would you call that but a sin?",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_forest.35": "I did not mean to sadden you, my love.#$b#It is my hope that by sharing such events you are able to view the world and its components within the context of the past.#$b#If you are able to gain something approaching insight from these stories then they are worth telling.",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_forest.36": "Now, shall we leave the grim topics of history where they lay?#$b#I would love to enjoy this beautiful day further with you, my love.",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_forest.37": "Lance and I spent the rest of the afternoon strolling along the river...",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_forest.38": "...I think I've come to understand him a little better.",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_forest.39": "Despite the grim conversation topic, I greatly enjoyed our walk through the forest, my love.#$b#There is nothing better than sharing in the stunning nature of this valley with you.",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_lake.01": "Ah yes, the spring.#$b#We are overdue for another date there, aren't we?",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_lake.02": "...What do you say to taking a swim in the spring this time?#$b#I'm sure you've already learned of the special properties of the water there.#$b#Unlike the ocean, it is always temperate outside of winter.",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_lake.03": "Wonderful!#$b#Let us make a quick stop at home to grab our swimming clothes.",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_lake.04": "Still as beautiful as you first laid eyes upon it, my love?",

    "Date.Picnic.Later_lake.27": "Lance and I spent a lot of time practicing my mana channelling...",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_lake.28": "...By the end, we were both more than a little... impatient.",

    "Date.Picnic.Later_lake.32": "I don't think I can last much longer without your touch, my love.#$b#Shall we begin by peeling off our wet clothing?#$b#I'm sure I could assist you in that process.",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_lake.33": "@... my @...#$b#How your beauty outshines even a place such as this...#$b#...The glistening magic of spring compliments the spreading flush of your skin more than even I expected.#$b#How perfect you are my love, both inside and out.",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_lake.34": "Hmm?#$b#Indeed I said it was awkward to engage in such activities inside a friend's domain,#$b# ...but I changed my mind.#$b#Plus, you saw how eager the sprites were for us to 'make babies'.#$b#How could I deny them an earnest attempt at least?#$e#I certainly enjoyed the process.#$b#Judging by your actions in that cave, you did as well.",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_secretwoods.01": "Explore the secret woods, is it?#$b#I don't see why not.#$b#I will have to briefly extend the barrier somewhat.#$b#I would not want an errant slime to interrupt our date.",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_secretwoods.02": "Take my hand, beloved.#$b#Let us take our time during this stroll.",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_secretwoods.03": "Hmm...#$b#It doesn't look like the barrier is having any issues.#$b#Frankly, I had expected as much.#$b#The slimes living in this forest are on the weaker side.",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_secretwoods.04": "Let us continue our stroll, shall we?#$b#There are plenty of interesting features I have been waiting to introduce to you.",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_secretwoods.05": "Ah, these little bridges?#$b#I had an adventurer put them together to allow for easier access to the unique ingredients this forest offers.#$b#While they look somewhat haphazard, they have withstood quite a few decades of use.#$b#I may reinforce them with magic to be certain, however.#$b#I know you are quite fond of visiting here.",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_secretwoods.06": "May I offer you a hand, dear @?^May I offer you a hand, my lady?",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_secretwoods.07": "Oh, these pillars?#$b#I have done some research within both the Ministry archives and mundane resources, but it would appear this site was originally the location for some ancient temple that has since been swallowed by nature.#$b#You can see more remains of the central structure in the form of that maze of pillars below.",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_secretwoods.08": "Ah, the pillars at the farm?#$b#...Yes, I sourced them from around this area.#$b#I hope you do not mind.#$b#Their long history has anchored them to this land itself, thus they make excellent focal points for magic related to the valley.",

    "Date.Picnic.Later_secretwoods.11": "Outside of the inscription describing the figure as 'Old Man Cannoli', I have yet to find any other information about this shrine.",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_secretwoods.12": "Ah, you found a stardrop after making an offering here?#$b#How fascinating!#$b#Stardrop fruit are interesting objects in general.#$b#While they are described as fruit and bear many resemblances to such, I suspect they are something else entirely.#$b#That does not change the fact that eating one permanently alters one's body in a purely beneficial way.#$b#It will serve you well to locate and ingest as many as possible.",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_secretwoods.13": "Me?#$b#I am already effectively immortal, my love. How much healthier do I need to be?",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_secretwoods.14": "I know you worry for me, but I am alright, @.#$b#If my winter energy levels could be solved in such a way, I would have already purchased a vast hoard of the things to store in my tower long ago.#$b#Do not hesitate to eat each one you find, my love.#$b#You are the one who would most benefit from it.",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_secretwoods.15": "Come, my love.#$b#I believe we have one more stop by the pond.",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_secretwoods.16": "...What a wonderful stroll it has been.",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_secretwoods.17": "I'm glad we took the time to do this, my love.#$b#I must have walked this forest something approach ten thousand times over the course of my years in the valley, but it has never felt as magical as when I hold your hand.#$b#Sometimes it truly is just about spending some time together and taking in the world around us.#$b#I cannot imagine a more perfect day.",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_secretwoods.18": "Well...#$b#...I can think of one thing that may improve it further...",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_secretwoods.19": "Mmmm...#$b#Open up a little more, my love.#$b#I long to kiss your deepest depths.#$b#Ah!#$b#Nghh...#$b#What a domineering person, you are, beloved.^What a domineering woman, you are, beloved.#$b#I would not have it any other way.",
    "Date.Picnic.Later_secretwoods.20": "...You are my guiding star, @.#$b#How brilliant the world is when cast in your light!#$b#Even the smallest things bring me such joy when we are together!#$b#May I ever bask in your warmth.",

    "Date.Beach.Base.02": "It isn't much, but I've completed a few hasty arrangements to make our time as comfortable as possible.",
    "Date.Beach.Base.03": "I've also acquired pizza and soft drinks from the saloon as per the modern custom.",

    "Date.Beach.Base.08": "Fascinating...#$b#The casual and contained nature of the dish makes it ideal for ingesting in an outdoor setting with a group of others.#$b#Although, transporting it intact proves quite the challenge when not doing so with that being the sole intention...",

    "Date.Beach.Base.1116021_swim.05": "At the time I hated the position.#$b# You're aware of how hot the Fern Islands become.#$b#I'm sure I've told you what happened to my robes.#$b#Yet, all wizards now learn temperature-regulation and water-repelling spells as one of their first assignments!#$b#Can you imagine it, @?#$b# Some of my most physically miserable years reduced to the empty complaints of an 'ancient fossil' who couldn't cast spells an apprentice can today!#$b#I was incensed to say the least.#$b#How quickly times change.",
    "Date.Beach.Base.1116021_swim.06": "Well, @?",

    "Date.Beach.Late.01": "@, you've arrived.",
    "Date.Beach.Late.02": "I have summoned forth our usual preparations and purchased food from the saloon. I hope it pleases you.",
    "Date.Beach.Late.02.1": "Why do I always insist on taking on preparations?#$b#You are always occupied with the farm, my love. I cannot ask you to do more when I am the one inviting you on the date begin with.#$b#Now, if you are in the mode to ever *invite me* on a date, that is a different story.",
    "Date.Beach.Late.03": "No need to apologize, @.#$b#You do enough for our day-to-day lives as is.#$b#I had no idea so much effort was required for maintaining a functional home until we began living together.",
    "Date.Beach.Late.04": "I did not concern myself with comforts when I lived alone at the tower.#$b#It was oftentimes enough to clean up with the use of a few organization and cleansing spells. #$b#Occasionally, the tower would even fall into disarray when I was forced to conserve my energies for more critical tasks.#$b#I do not enjoy living in squalor, of course, but nothing much mattered to me outside of my experiments during that time.",
    "Date.Beach.Late.05": "...Thinking back, I supplemented much of what I needed with magic.#$b#Even the herbs and plants I grow indoors are maintained with spells...#$b#So much for being a plant expert!#$b#The fact you accomplish so much with your own two hands is endlessly impressive to me, my love.",
    "Date.Beach.Late.05.1": "That is a very charitable way to describe it, beloved.#$b#But I suppose you are right, as long as the result is roughly the same, what's to say one method is better than the other?#$b#But I digress. Shall we finally partake in this meal, my love?#$b#The saloon owner promised me its many merits.",
    "Date.Beach.Late.06": "How do I select what to purchase?#$b#I largely depend on my research to check what is appropriate for such occasions.#$b#As you would expect, I do not own books that detail trends of the modern era so at times I've visited the town library for additional guidance.#$b#The bookkeeper of this town has always been strangely enthusiastic about attempting to make conversation with me, however, thus I usually employ an invisibility charm.",
    "Date.Beach.Late.07": "...A history buff?#$b#Ah, I suppose that does explain it. #$b#I should have known, truly.#$b#Outside of adventurers and those who are expressly interested in the occult, the last remaining group of mundane that seek us out tend to be historians.#$b#I doubt I would actually be of much help considering the majority of what I know pertains to the magical world. #$b#In general, it's rare for practitioners to take much interest in the mundane world once their immediate loved ones have passed or change affects them in some way.#$b#I have been noticing the increasing number of interesting artifacts amassing in that building, however.#$b#Your work I assume?#$b#Most such changes seem to have you as their catalyst if not outright center, my love.",
    "Date.Beach.Late.08": "I see!#$b#Perhaps we can make some time to view the specimens you have gathered at some point.#$b#During another date, perhaps?#$b#But I digress. Let us focus on the current one.#$b#To answer your original question, outside of research, I take Gus' recommendations often.#$b#...He also seems quite invested in having conversations with me, but for a completely different reason.",
    "Date.Beach.Late.09": "What reason?#$b#The success of our ongoing romance...#$b#It appears saloon keepers are often the noisy sort in regards to their customers' well-being.",
    "Date.Beach.Late.10": "What do I mean by summon?#$b#My love, you didn't think I physically carried all of this to the beach each time did you?#$b#To summon something is to call it forth from a known location and pull it to another. #$b#Generally, it is only possible with relatively small and inanimate objects, but it is possible to summon living beings of the more spiritual variety.#$b#...Assuming they agree to said summons, and a medium of some sort is used at least.",
    "Date.Beach.Late.11": "Is it possible to summon people?#$b#In theory, yes, but it would require the summoner and the summonee to have linked their souls together.#$b#It is usually far more practical to warp to the person, make physical contact with them and teleport together than it is to summon a material being.#$b#The mechanics behind is quite the bit of complicated magical theory so I will leave it for another time.",
    "Date.Beach.Late.12": "What of conjuring?#$b#That is an entirely different matter entirely.#$b#To conjure is to create something from scratch out of either mana alone or with the addition of sacrificial matter.#$b#You can imagine how much more taxing that is to rearrange the essence of an object compared to simply relocating it.#$b#Generally, the more similar the material is, the easier it is to conjure, but that often steps into the realm of transmutation than pure conjuring.#$b#Considering your talent in that particular field, I would not be surprised to learn that you make an excellent conjurer as well.",
    "Date.Beach.Late.12.1": "Now, let us not become too distracted by discussions of magic.#$b#Please go ahead and eat, my love. The saloon owner guaranteed the quality of this dish.",
    "Date.Beach.Late.13": "Yum! The burger is super juicy!",
    "Date.Beach.Late.14": "Delicious!#$b#I have slowly grown to appreciate the food of this era, most of it thanks to your efforts, my love.#$b#Subsisting on energies alone may be efficient, but there is a certain charm to sharing a meal.#$b#You always make an effort I am eating well, @.#$b#For that, I can't thank you enough.",
    "Date.Beach.Late.15": "How refreshing.",
    "Date.Beach.Late.16": "Indeed, it has been a while since I've rambled about my analysis of modern cuisine.#$b#Shall I start again? You seemed quite amused by it. ",
    "Date.Beach.Late.17": "Joking, my love.#$b#After spending the last few years with you, I have been trying to view life outside of my knowledge-seeking scope.#$b#Whether it is entirely successful or not, I do not know, but I am certainly enjoying my time more.#$b#I'm sure the presence of a certain spirited farmer is helping much in that regard.^I'm sure the presence of a certain beautiful young woman is helping much in that regard.",
    "Date.Beach.Late.18": "But I digress.#$b#Take the leftovers, my love. I procured much from Gus.",
    "Date.Beach.Late.19": "[903]I prefer your cooking over all else's, of course, but it is good to explore options once in a while.#$b#I wouldn't want you taking the entirety of these burdens, after all.",

    "Date.Beach.Late.21": "Now, that the meal has settled, what to do you say we continue our date, my love?#$b#What are you in the mood for?",
    "Date.Beach.Late.22": "What should we do now?",
    "Date.Beach.Late.23": "Let's play in the water!",
    "Date.Beach.Late.24": "Let's explore the tide pools!",
    "Date.Beach.Late.25": "Let's sit on the pier and watch the waves!",
    "Date.Beach.Late_swim.01": "The water is it?#$b#I shall reinforce the glimmer and change in that case.#$b#Please don't stare at me too intently.",
    "Date.Beach.Late_swim.02": "Ah...The ocean breeze, the smell of the surf...",
    "Date.Beach.Late_swim.03": "Can you hold back a little, my love?#$b#I feel as if you are readying yourself to swallow me whole.#$b#Glimmer or not, we are still in public after all!",
    "Date.Beach.Late_swim.04": "How is it you are sometimes so bold with your affections yet other times you shy at the slightest comment?#$b#Perhaps one day I will understand and use that knowledge to my advantage, but for now I remain at your mercy, my heart.",
    "Date.Beach.Late_swim.05": "Let us delay no longer, @.#$b#The sea waits for us!",
    "Date.Beach.Late_swim.06": "Quite temperate, indeed.#$b#It is much better without heavy robes, that is for sure!",
    "Date.Beach.Late_swim.07": "I'm glad you enjoy it much more as well, my love.#$b#Magic is often a very practical thing, but that does not mean it is always the best option.#$b#Sometimes it is simply better to strip to one's underclothes and jump head in!",
    "Date.Beach.Late_swim.08": "Hmm? What are you doing beloved?",
    "Date.Beach.Late_swim.09": "I caught Lance off guard and splashed water all over him.",

    "OceanWalk_Wander1.4": "The other, however...#$b#I'm sure you've realised from the carvings and items scattered about, but this was once an area inhabited by a large dwarven colony during the Elemental Wars.#$b#It had long since collapsed by the time I'd stepped foot on these islands, but the remnants are present nonetheless.#$b#Despite the Ministry's best attempts at 'cleaning up', there still remain countless artifacts littering these shores.#$b#While the majority are inert, a few are known to activate spontaneously once certain conditions are met.#$b#The end result is a plethora of old wives' tales of strange happenings or unpredictable weather.#$b#Experienced sailors know to keep away, but even the most skilled sometimes fall when with faced with situations beyond their understanding.#$b#....And this is the result.",
    "OceanWalk_Wander1.5": "There is no doubt strides have been made to eliminate the danger of this area, but certain artifacts simply cannot be relocated.#$b#A perfect example would be the forge atop the volcano, hence the Ministry's insistence on assigning a watch here.",

    "OceanWalk_Wander2NoChild.8": "Yet you think I would rather have you compromise instead?#$b#...I am very much aware that my vision of parenthood is very much an idealized one, @.#$b#If I had truly been so determined, I would have long inquired into the process of adopting a child during my long years of isolation.#$b#...Yet, I never did.#$b#Frankly, I did not even have the confidence in accepting an apprentice prior to our meeting!#$b#If you are not committed to the concept of having children, then it would be for the best that we do not.#$b#After all, this is a partnership.#$b#How could I possibly demand such a thing of you when I myself did not truly put the effort towards seeing it through?",
    "OceanWalk_Wander2NoChild.9": "Then we shall have children.#$b#Such are the benefits afforded to us by the length of our lives, my heart.#$b#Please do not force yourself to come to a decision that you are not fully committed to for my sake, however.#$b#You are the one who brought joy back to my life.#$b#There is no need to force yourself to accept children you do not want in an attempt to make me happy.",

    "OceanWalk_Wander2SingleChild.1": "Still, I wonder if there is not something more we could do for our brilliant little spark.#$b#In an era such as this one, there are strict limitations in terms of others their age they are able to freely associate with. #$b#Morgan's presence in the valley will surely be of assistance, but I cannot help but wonder if perhaps it would be ideal if %kid1 were to have a younger sibling.",

    "OceanWalk_Wander3Outfit.0": "#Is being a 'magical being' also the reason why your eyes glow? #You know, I've been meaning to ask, but what's the difference between a monster and a magical being?",
    "OceanWalk_Wander3Outfit.1": "Ah, well...#$b#That is a rather difficult question for me, my heart.",
    "OceanWalk_Wander3Outfit.2": "There has been significant research done on altering the flesh....#$b# ...Most of it fueled by the whims of one practitioner or another in pursuit of an uncountable number of motives...#$b#Yet, the study of what long term mana exposure does to a human body is very limited.#$b#The reality is simply that the number of magic wielders who experienced these effects on any major scale are largely limited to my fellow planes practitioners.#$b#To put it bluntly, we have far more to worry about than what strange shade our hair has warped into or that our eyes have suddenly began producing light.#$b#...I am speaking from personal experience, of course.",
    "OceanWalk_Wander3Outfit.3": "I do not wish to give you the impression that they are all bad changes, my heart.#$b#While there is no tangible benefit or deficit to my hair or skin changing colour outside of looking 'odd', not all changes are equal.#$b#The alteration of my eyes in particular has resulted in me having far improved vision at night compared to the average person.#$b#...Although, I will be honest...#$b#...Even I was not aware of their ability glow prior to our meeting, my heart.#$b#I hope it is not too disruptive in the dark when we are settling down for the night.",

    "OceanWalk_Wander3Outfit.5": "I have not personally attempted it, but I have heard rumour of the change slowly returning over time.#$b#It may be that the effect of the 'warping' supersedes any intentional changing of the body...#$b#...Or it may simply be that we are inclined to 'warp' in a certain way and will unintentionally return to the same appearance.#$b#Tangent aside, let us return to your original question.",
    "OceanWalk_Wander3Outfit.6": "No, that is for certain.#$b#Due to the nature of our existence, it is common for planes practitioners to keep to themselves.#$b#Of the two I have met in person, however...#$b#One had taken on a form that made her somewhat resemble a plant-human hybrid.#$b#She seemed pleased with the changes and further emphasised them with magic.#$b#The other, however, developed horn-like growths along their arms despite looking human in every other aspect.#$b#I was told it was quite the ordeal to sand them down every few years.",
    "OceanWalk_Wander3Outfit.7": "Indeed. My 'warping' seems far more mundane compared to the two, but I suspect the internal mechanics of this body have been altered far more dramatically.#$b#After all, I am the only person who is capable of abstaining from food for ambient absorption even now.#$b#In that sense, I am far more 'plant like' than the self-proclaimed plant woman will ever be.#$b#Jests aside, let us return to your original question.",
    "OceanWalk_Wander3Outfit.8": "That is more a question for the Ministry, but if I had to estimate....#$b# ...I would think our numbers do not exceed 30.",

Yes, I suppose that would indeed seem rather shocking compared to the number of practitioners of other studies.#$b#All practitioners hold personal power beyond that of a normal person, no matter how small.#$b#But for those that master the planes...#$b#Let us simply say that it would be rather troublesome to combat under the worse-case scenario.#$b#It should not surprise you that the Ministry is very cautious of who is allowed to study the art when the potential for abuse is so significant.#$b#Even after eliminating those that do not possess a suitable character....#$b#...You are aware of my nightmares.#$b#It is simply something that not many wish to endure.",
